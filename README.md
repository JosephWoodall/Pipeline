# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

### Classification Pipeline

Returns:
    Final Analytics of Selected Classification Algorithm: 
    
    Available Models for use include: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier
    Available Metrics for result interpretation include: accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, average percision, and roc auc.
    
TODO: 
- Add preprocessing to Data class
- Add hyperparameter tuning to Models class
- Add more error metrics  
- Add visualizations for each error metric  
- Update read me and code comments for use  
- Add more classifiers and fine tune their parameters 
- Add regressors and appropriate toy data
